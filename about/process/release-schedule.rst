Release Schedule
================

OTA updates usually follow this rhythm:

-  devel: daily builds
-  rc: weekly if no critical issue exists in the devel channel
-  stable: every six through eight weeks, if no critical issue
   exists in the rc channel

This is not a definitive cycle. Stable releases are ready when they're
ready and should not introduce new bugs or ship very incomplete
features. Since the OTA update can not be released before all critical
issues are closed, the ETA might have to be moved by making an educated
guess for when all the issues can be handled. If there are too many
issues added to a milestone, they are either removed or added
to the next milestone.
