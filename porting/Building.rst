Building
========

*Work in progress*

A Halium 9.0 - GSI port consists of the following parts:
    
    * The boot image, obtained by building the full halium-boot.img, or by compiling only the kernel and assembling the boot image based on this.
    * The system image, either a device specific one or the GSI (see :ref:`explanation of GSI <What-is-a-GSI>`)
    * The UBports - Ubuntu Touch - root file system (hereafter referred to as the *rootfs*)

Which of the above you need to build for your port depends on the porting method you have selected, as described in previous sections and pointed out below.
