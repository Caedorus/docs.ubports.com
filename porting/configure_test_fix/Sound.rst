The supplied touch.pa file located in the /etc/pulse directory of your device needs adjustment. Extract the file and copy it to your 'ubuntu' directory. 

Locate the line::

    load-module module-droid-discover voice_virtual_stream=true

and replace it with this::

    load-module module-droid-discover rate=48000 quirks=+unload_call_exit

At the end of the file, append this::

    ### Automatically load the audioflinger glue
    .ifexists module-droid-glue-24.so
    load-module module-droid-glue-24
    .endif

Now complete :ref:`steps 3 and 4 above <Overlay>`, taking care to remember the note on how to :ref:`Rebuild-system.img`.
