Base build
==========

The first milestone is to make a 'base build'. The goal here is to pick a suitable porting method, find suitable source code and fix enough things to be able to build the images for your device, install it and have some debug capabilities.

Just to be clear, that base build might still show a black screen and overall more or less do 'nothing' as far as what a user expects. But as a porter this is an important milestone. On top of this you will be able to work on the more high level features, like a working screen, radios, etc. This will be handled in the Test and fix section.
