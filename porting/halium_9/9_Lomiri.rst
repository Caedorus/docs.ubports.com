Bring up Lomiri - the graphical user interface
==============================================

Once your device boots correctly, you should only need to create a udev rules file to enable Lomiri. Refer to :ref:`Bring-up-Unity-8`

If you do not succeed in bringing up Lomiri, please seek help through one of the channels mentioned in the section :ref:`Getting-community-help`.

After bringing up the graphical user interface, the next step is to check and enable device functionality.
