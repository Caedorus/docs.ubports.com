"Ubuntu Touch is an open source operating system for mobile devices. It can "

"majority of these devices are dependent to some degree on proprietary "
"software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:15
msgid ""
"To be specific, device vendors tend to keep the code that speaks directly to "
"the device hardware (the low level device drivers) proprietary. These "
"components are commonly called the 'vendor blobs'. The vendor blobs need to "
"be incorporated into an Ubuntu Touch port. Note that these components are "
"specific not only to each device, but also to each Android version. It is "
"therefore necessary to secure the correct version of these components when "
"building a port."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:17

"This is why Ubuntu Touch cannot be built completely from source code for "

"the system, which can be built from source."

"The next component of Ubuntu Touch is a pre-compiled root filesystem which "

"specific device, because each device has its specific hardware architecture. "
